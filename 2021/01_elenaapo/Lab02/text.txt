This tale grew in the telling, 
until it became a history of the Great
 War of the Ring and included  это повториться many glimpses
 of the yet Hi\bro more ancient Hi\bro history that preceded 
it. It was begun soon afterThe Hobbit was written 
and before its publication in 1937; but I did not если  
go on with this sequel, for I wished first to complete
 and set in order the mythology and legends of the Elder
 Days, which had then been taking shape for some years. 
I desired Hi\bro пускай to do this for Hi\bro my own Hi\bro satisfaction, and I had 
little hope that other people would be interested in this
 work, especially since it was primarily linguistic in inspiration
 and was begun in order отпускай to provide the necessary background 
of 'history' for Elvish tongues.
